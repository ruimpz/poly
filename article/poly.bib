	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Large grids of synthetic spectra covering a wide range of stellar parameters are essential tools for different stellar and (extra-) Galactic physical applications. They can be used for the automatic parametrisation of stellar spectra such as that performed by the AMBRE project whose main goal is to determine the stellar atmospheric parameters of a few hundred thousands of archived spectra of four ESO spectrographs.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} To fulfil the needs of AMBRE and similar future projects, we computed a grid of synthetic spectra over the whole optical domain for cool to very cool stars of any luminosity (from dwarfs to supergiants) with metallicities varying from 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} to 10 times the solar metallicity, and considering large variations in the chemical composition of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-elements.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In these spectrum computations, we used new generation MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum code for radiative transfer. We also took into account atomic and molecular linelists that were as complete as possible and adopted, in the spectral synthesis, the same physical assumptions and input data as in the MARCS models. This allowed us to present a grid in which there is a high consistency between the atmosphere models and the synthetic spectra.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present a new grid of 16 783 high resolution spectra over the wavelength range 3000 Å to 12 000 Å computed at a spectral resolution higher than 150 000. Normalised and absolute flux versions are available over a wide range of stellar atmospheric parameters for stars of FGKM spectral types. The parameters covered are 2500 K ≤ {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ≤ 8000 K, −0.5 ≤ log({\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) ≤ 5.5 dex, and −5.0 ≤ [M/H] ≤ + 1.0 dex. Moreover, for each combination of these stellar parameters, five different values of the enrichment in {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-elements were considered (0.0, ± 0.2 dex and ± 0.4 dex around the standard values). This library is thus relevant to any stellar type and luminosity class, present in old and intermediate-age stellar populations with chemical composition varying from extremely metal-poor to metal-rich. This grid is made publicly available through the POLLUX database (about 50\% of the spectra have been included in this database) and in FITS format upon request to the authors.},

There are several methods to derive these parameters and a comparison of their results often shows considerable discrepancies, even in the restricted group of solar-type FGK dwarfs.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We want to check the differences in temperature between the standard spectroscopic technique based on iron lines and the infrared flux method (IRFM). We aim to improve the description of the spectroscopic temperatures especially for the cooler stars where the differences between the two methods are higher, as presented in a previous work.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Our spectroscopic analysis was based on the iron excitation and ionization balance, assuming Kurucz model atmospheres in LTE. The abundance analysis was determined using the code MOOG. We optimized the line list using a cool star (HD 21749) with high resolution and high signal-to-noise spectrum, as a reference in order to check for weak, isolated lines.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We test the quality of the new line list by re-deriving stellar parameters for 451 stars with high resolution and signal-to-noise HARPS spectra, that were analyzed in a previous work with a larger line list. The comparison in temperatures between this work and the latest IRFM for the stars in common shows that the differences for the cooler stars are significantly smaller and more homogeneously distributed than in previous studies for stars with temperatures below 5000 K. Moreover, a comparison is presented between interferometric temperatures with our results that shows good agreement, even though the sample is small and the errors of the mean differences are large. We use the new line list to re-derive parameters for some of the cooler stars that host planets. Finally, we present the impact of the new temperatures on the [Cr i/Cr ii] and [Ti i/Ti ii] abundance ratios that previously showed systematic trends with temperature. We show that the slopes of these trends for the cooler stars become drastically smaller.},

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We address the existence and origin of the lithium (Li) desert, a region in the Li-T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} plane sparsely populated by stars. Here we analyze some of the explanations that have been suggested for this region, including mixing in the late main sequence, a Li dip origin for stars with low Li abundances in the region, and a possible relation with the presence of planets. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: To study the Li desert, we measured the atmospheric parameters and Li abundance of 227 late-F dwarfs and subgiants, chosen to be in the T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} range of the desert and without previous Li abundance measurements. Subsequently, we complemented those with literature data to obtain a homogeneous catalog of 2318 stars, for which we compute masses and ages. We characterize stars surrounding the region of the Li desert. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We conclude that stars with low Li abundances below the desert are more massive and more evolved than stars above the desert. Given the unexpected presence of low Li abundance stars in this effective temperature range, we concentrate on finding their origin. We conclude that these stars with low Li abundance do not evolve from stars above the desert: at a given mass, stars with low Li (i.e., below the desert) are more metal-poor. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Instead, we suggest that stars below the Li desert are consistent with having evolved from the Li dip, discarding the need to invoke additional mixing to explain this feature. Thus, stars below the Li desert are not peculiar and are only distinguished from other subgiants evolved from the Li dip in that their combination of atmospheric parameters locates them in a range of effective temperatures where otherwise only high Li abundance stars would be found (i.e., stars above the desert). {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Tables 1 and 3 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} ({\textless}A href="http://130.79.128.5"{\textgreater}http://130.79.128.5{\textless}/A{\textgreater}) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/614/A55"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/614/A55{\textless}/A{\textgreater}This paper includes observations collected at The McDonald Observatory and observations gathered with the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201116979},
	abstract = {Aims: We describe and study a family of new multigrid iterative solvers for the multidimensional, implicitly discretized equations of hydrodynamics. Schemes of this class are free of the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. They are intended for simulations in which widely differing wave propagation timescales are present. A preferred solver in this class is identified. Applications to some simple stiff test problems that are governed by the compressible Euler equations, are presented to evaluate the convergence behavior, and the stability properties of this solver. Algorithmic areas are determined where further work is required to make the method sufficiently efficient and robust for future application to difficult astrophysical flow problems. Methods: The basic equations are formulated and
discretized on non-orthogonal, structured curvilinear meshes. Roe's approximate Riemann solver and a second-order accurate reconstruction scheme are used for spatial discretization. Implicit Runge-Kutta
(ESDIRK) schemes are employed for temporal discretization. The resulting discrete equations are solved with a full-coarsening, non-linear
multigrid method. Smoothing is performed with multistage-implicit smoothers. These are applied here to the time-dependent equations by means of dual time stepping. Results: For steady-state problems,
our results show that the efficiency of the present approach is
comparable to the best implicit solvers for conservative discretizations of the compressible Euler equations that can be found in the literature. The use of red-black as opposed to symmetric Gauss-Seidel iteration in the multistage-smoother is found to have only a minor impact on
multigrid convergence. This should enable scalable parallelization without having to seriously compromise the method's algorithmic
efficiency. For time-dependent test problems, our results reveal that the multigrid convergence rate degrades with increasing Courant numbers (i.e. time step sizes). Beyond a Courant number of nine thousand, even complete multigrid breakdown is observed. Local Fourier analysis
indicates that the degradation of the convergence rate is associated with the coarse-grid correction algorithm. An implicit scheme for the Euler equations that makes use of the present method was, nevertheless, able to outperform a standard explicit scheme on a time-dependent problem with a Courant number of order 1000. Conclusions: For
steady-state problems, the described approach enables the construction of parallelizable, efficient, and robust implicit hydrodynamics solvers. The applicability of the method to time-dependent problems is presently restricted to cases with moderately high Courant numbers. This is due to an insufficient coarse-grid correction of the employed multigrid
algorithm for large time steps. Further research will be required to help us to understand and overcome the observed multigrid convergence difficulties for time-dependent problems.},
